    "### Two Sum Problem With a Twist\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Two Sum** problem is a classic coding challenge that involves finding two numbers in an array that add up to a given target. The challenge is to return the indices of the two numbers, not the numbers themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an array of integers and a target integer, find two indices such that the numbers at these indices add up to the target. The indices must be different, and the order of the indices does not matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimal solution to this problem involves using a hash map (or dictionary in Python) to store the numbers we've seen so far and their indices. For each number, we calculate its complement (the difference between the target and the current number). We then check if this complement is in the hash map. If it is, we've found the two numbers that add up to the target, and we return their indices. If the complement is not in the hash map, we add the current number and its index to the hash map.\n"
