    "### Minimize Partition Difference Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an array $A$ of $n$ integers, where $n$ is the number of elements in the array, we want to partition $A$ into two sub-arrays $A1$ and $A2$ such that the difference between their sums is minimized. \n",
    "\n",
    "- $A1$ as the first sub-array ending at index $i$.\n",
    "- $A2$ as the second sub-array starting at index $i+1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sum of $A1$ is represented as $S1 = A[0] + A[1] +... + A[i]$, and the sum of $A2$ is represented as $S2 = A[i+1] + A[i+2] +... + A[n-1]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective is to minimize $|S1 - S2|$, where $|...|$ denotes the absolute value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dynamic Programming Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "- Suppose $dp[i][j]$ represent the minimum difference between the sums of the two sub-arrays when the first sub-array ends at index $i$ and the second sub-array starts at index $j$.\n",
    "- The base case is when $i = 0$ and $j = 0$, which means the first sub-array is empty and the second sub-array contains all elements. In this case, $dp[0][0] = 0$.\n",
    "- For each $i$ from $1$ to $n-1$, and for each $j$ from $i$ to $n-1$, we calculate $dp[i][j]$ as:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    $dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], abs(S1 - S2))$ Where:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - $S1$ is the sum of the elements from index $0$ to $i$\n",
    "    - $S2$ is the sum of the elements from index $i+1$ to $j$.\n",
    "- The minimum difference between the sums of the two sub-arrays can be represented as: $min(|S1 - S2|) = min(dp[n-1][n-1])$ Where $dp[n-1][n-1]$ is the minimum value in the last row of the $dp$ array.\n"

The use of cumulative sums $sum1$ and $sum2$ ensures that the sums are calculated efficiently, and the $dp$ array is updated correctly to reflect the minimum difference for each pair $(i, j)$."
