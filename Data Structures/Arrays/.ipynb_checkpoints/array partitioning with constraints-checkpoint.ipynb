    "### Minimum Partition Difference with Target Sum Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In the realm of array manipulation and optimization, a common challenge is to partition an array into two sub-arrays such that the difference between their sums is minimized, with specific constraints applied. This problem is particularly interesting when a target sum is introduced, aiming to balance the sums of the two sub-arrays as closely as possible to this target. The constraints ensure that each sub-array contains at least one element, and one of the sub-arrays should strive to have a sum as close to the target sum as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach and Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "To tackle this problem, we employ a straightforward yet effective approach that leverages the properties of array sums and the constraints provided. The solution involves iterating through the array, calculating the total sum, and dynamically adjusting the sums of the two sub-arrays to minimize the difference while adhering to the constraints.\n"
